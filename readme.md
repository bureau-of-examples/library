### LibraryApp

This demo project was created by following Pluralsight course:
<cite>
Building Web Applications with Node.js and Express 4.0
</cite>

To run the app you need to:
- install MongoDB with default configuration
- run npm install to pull in the node modules
- run <code>gulp serve</code>

You will probably need to play with MongoDB a bit, e.g.
- connect to a database: <code>mongod DB_NAME</code>
- list all objects in a collection: <code>db.COLLECTION_NAME.find({})</code>
- clear a collection: <code>db.COLLECTION_NAME.remove({})</code>
